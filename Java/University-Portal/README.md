Created a University Portal using Java GUI and MySQL for the database.
Made the Login Form that asks for Username, Password and what is the users role (e.g. Student, Faculty Memeber, Department Head or Administrator). Though I've already made passwords and username for them.
If incorrect it will display a message to state that its incorrect please try again.
Once through it will show you pages like if you are student it will display the students menu. On the menu things like the students profile, the students course, the students marks for there modules/subjects will appear.
If a Faculty Member it will display the menu. On the menu options like View student marks, delete students, update students, show the all the students will appear.
If Department Head it will display the menu. On the menu optioms like View Faculty and students list, View students and marks, delete and update students will appear.
As for the Administrator is able to access everything.
All the information is stored in the Database.
